<p>I am a full time mom of 5, Samantha, Riley, Deja, Coe and Annabelle. I live in North Central Kansas 
    and am currently in school for coding. I enjoy spending 
    time with my family and my plants. I have one dog, Kytah and 
    3 grandchildren, Gracin, Wilder, and Daxx. I work at an elementary school
    just over the border into Nebraska. And a loyal Husker fan I am.
